    <p><em>".Two score and six years ago, a legend was born, guitar pick in one hand, royal instrument in the other, the power of rock already dwelling deep inside his heart. The babe's name was Jack Black, and he was put here on Earth to cure all of our sorrows and dispatch all of our troubles with song â€” and, occasionally, a broadsword."</em></p>
